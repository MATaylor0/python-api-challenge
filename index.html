  <h1>Python API Challenge</h1>

  <p>
    WeatherPy, an analysis of cities across the globe, selected at random to determine if there is a relationship between latitude and various weather related metrics. Powered by Open Weather API.

    <h3>Latitude vs Max Temperature</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>By simply looking at the plot generated, it appears that there is a correlation between latitude and max temperature</li>
        <li>The max temperature tends to reach it's maximum as latitude approaches 0 (the equator) which we would expect</li>
    </ul>
